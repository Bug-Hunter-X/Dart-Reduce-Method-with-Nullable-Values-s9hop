# Dart Reduce Method and Nullable Values

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `reduce` method in Dart with lists containing nullable values. The `reduce` method requires a binary operation that always produces a non-null value. If a null value is encountered during the reduction process, an error is thrown.

## Problem
The `reduce` method is a powerful tool for combining list elements. However, when working with nullable values, it's crucial to implement appropriate null handling to prevent unexpected runtime errors.

The bug.dart file shows an example of this error. The code attempts to sum a list containing nullable integers, resulting in a runtime exception when a null value is reached.

## Solution
The bugSolution.dart file illustrates a corrected approach using the null-aware operator (`?.`) and the ?? operator to ensure that the reduction process handles null values gracefully.
